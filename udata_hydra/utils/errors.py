class ExceptionWithSentryDetails(Exception):
    """
    Custom exception that automatically captures to Sentry with enriched tags when
    raised.

    This implementation captures the exception in the __str__ method, ensuring the
    full stack trace is available.

    The exception automatically attaches resource ID, URL, check ID, and other
    context to Sentry events. Tags and exception capture happen in the same scope,
    ensuring all the custom tags (resource details, step information, etc.) are
    preserved.

    Two previous approaches failed:
    - Capturing in __init__: No stack trace is available, because __init__ is
      running when the exception is created, while __str__ runs when it's raised
      and converted to a string, which provides the complete call stack.
    - Separate scopes: Tags were set in a temporary scope that got destroyed
      before exception capture, resulting in Sentry events without the custom
      tags. Later, when trying to capture the exception, those tags were no
      longer available.

    Usage:
        raise ExceptionWithSentryDetails(
            message="Something went wrong",
            step="data_processing",
            resource_id="123",
            url="https://example.com/data.csv",
            check_id=456,
